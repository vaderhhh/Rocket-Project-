# Rocket-Project-
Avionics code for the UCLA Rocket Project Foundry Team 

The purpose of the avionics for Foundry is to trigger the multistage seperation using an accelerometer-Arduino setup. After a certain acceleration threshold is reached the Arduino will trigger relays (after a user set delay) which would complete the circuit with a 9V battery and a series of Ematches, thus blowing the Ematches and igniting the explosives needed for seperation/ignition.
